A simple programmer's calculator. There are buttons for decimal/hexadecimal/octal/and binary for easy conversion.

Calculations are done in double-precision floating-point, therefore there is a range limit of -(2^53) to +(2^53). An error is displayed when the result goes out of this range. Integer operatons automatically reject the fractional part.

Keyboard commands are similar to C operations:
+ add
- subtract
* multiply
/ divide
& and
| or
^ xor
% modulus
= (or Enter) get result
Backspace deletes last character
Escape clears result
